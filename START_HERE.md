- Enable Email/Password auth
- Create Firestore database
- Copy Firebase config

**Guide**: See `QUICKSTART.md`

### 2. Test Locally (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Add Firebase credentials to .env

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

**Checklist**: See `CHECKLIST.md` section 2-3

### 3. Push to GitHub (2 minutes)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Smart Issue Board"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/smart-issue-board.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Guide**: See `GITHUB_SETUP.md`

### 4. Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
- Import GitHub repository to Vercel
- Add environment variables
- Deploy

**Guide**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md`

### 5. Final Testing (5 minutes)
- Test all features on production
- Update README.md with live URL
- Complete final checklist

**Guide**: See `CHECKLIST.md` section 8

## 📚 Documentation Highlights

### README.md
- **Why React + Vite?**
  - Fast HMR, better performance than CRA
  - Simpler than Next.js for this scope
  - Modern build tool with great DX

- **Firestore Structure**:
  - Flat structure: single `issues` collection
  - All fields documented with types
  - Timestamps as ISO strings
  - Efficient querying strategy

- **Similar Issue Detection**:
  - Client-side algorithm (instant feedback)
  - Substring matching + word overlap
  - Proactive prevention with user override
  - Balance between accuracy and performance

- **Challenges**:
  - Algorithm complexity vs simplicity
  - Firebase security rules learning
  - Real-time updates vs performance
  - Vite environment variables

- **Future Improvements**:
  - Real-time collaboration with listeners
  - Advanced ML-based similarity
  - Comment threads and history
  - User profiles with avatars
  - And 6 more ideas!

   - Performance vs accuracy tradeoffs
   - User experience considerations

4. **Deployment**:
   - Vite environment variables
   - Vercel configuration
   - Firebase authorized domains

## 🔒 Security Implemented

✅ Environment variables for Firebase config
✅ .gitignore prevents .env commits
✅ Firebase Auth for user management
